# luna-os
A shell for MS-DOS made in Turbo C++.

# Info
It was started after I happened to take an intrest in Turbo C++ and MS-DOS. I then began the project, and then made the Github.

# Build
I have no way of really testing if it works on real hardware, so the only listing here is DOSBOX.
DOSBOX:
> 1. Download the zip file for this project
> 2. Download Turbo C++ 2.0 (2.1 if possible)
> 3. Install Turbo C++ in DOSBOX
> 4. Run the makefile
> 5. Bootup and type in the command `begin`
